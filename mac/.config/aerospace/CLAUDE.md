AeroSpace tiling window manager config for macOS. i3-like behavior with vim-style keybindings.

## Commands

```bash
aerospace reload-config          # Apply changes (or alt-shift-; then esc)
aerospace list-windows --all     # Debug window assignments
aerospace list-workspaces        # See all workspaces
```

The daily build is the official `/Applications/AeroSpace.app`, currently
`0.21.3-Beta`. AeroSpace manages its own login item through
`start-at-login = true`.

The config uses `config-version = 2`. `persistent-workspaces` explicitly
preserves the v1 behavior for all currently bound workspace keys.

## Keybindings

**Navigation** (alt + vim keys):
- `alt-hjkl` - Focus window left/down/up/right
- `alt-shift-hjkl` - Move window left/down/up/right

**Workspaces**:
- `alt-[1-0]` - Switch to workspace 1-10
- `alt-[a-z]` - Switch to letter workspace (except r, x reserved)
- `alt-shift-[key]` - Move window to that workspace
- `alt-tab` - Cycle non-empty workspaces on current monitor
- `alt-backtick` - Jump to next empty workspace
- `cmd-shift-backtick` - Move window to first empty workspace on the other monitor
- `alt-shift-tab` - Move workspace to next monitor

**Layout**:
- `alt-/` - Toggle tiles horizontal/vertical
- `alt-,` - Toggle accordion layout
- `alt--` / `alt-=` - Resize window

**Service mode** (`alt-shift-;`):
- `esc` - Reload config and exit
- `r` - Reset/flatten workspace layout
- `f` - Toggle floating/tiling
- `backspace` - Close all windows but current

## Monitor Setup

- Primary letter workspaces prefer `LG HDR 4K`, falling back to macOS `main`.
- Workspace 1 plus workspaces 2-10, E, F, G, M, O, Y, Z prefer the built-in display, falling back to `secondary` then `main`.
- AeroSpace `main` follows macOS System Settings -> Displays -> Use as Main Display; the config targets the LG by name so the main workspace group does not depend on that OS setting.

## Floating Apps

These apps launch floating instead of tiled: Ghostty, Alacritty, cmux, Warp, Finder, Books, mpv, CodexBar, Codex, CleanShot X, System Settings, Raycast.

CleanShot X, System Settings, Raycast, CoreServices UI Agent system prompts, and
Problem Reporter crash dialogs are floated in place so utility windows stay in
the workspace where they were invoked instead of hitting the empty-workspace
catch-all.

The final empty-workspace catch-all applies only to tiled windows. Windows
AeroSpace recognizes as dialogs are floating by default, so they remain beside
the application that opened them instead of being moved to another workspace.

PiP handling is centralized in `~/.local/bin/aerospace-pip-guardian`. Its automatic workspace-change mode moves AeroSpace-managed Helium `Picture-in-picture` windows to the focused workspace and unhides hidden Brave-owned YouTube PWA PiP windows. Press `ctrl-alt-p` to run the stronger recovery mode, which also recreates stale Helium native PiP windows by toggling the Google PiP extension.

The main ChatGPT window stays assigned to workspace `C`. AeroSpace
`0.21.0-Beta` and later recognizes the always-on-top `com.openai.codex` Pet as
an unmanaged popup, so it remains stable across workspace changes without a
sticky-window rule or helper.

## ChatGPT Pet Maintenance

- Keep AeroSpace at `0.21.0-Beta` or later for the built-in Codex Pet popup
  detection.
- After updating ChatGPT, confirm the Pet remains visible and stable while
  changing workspaces. If flickering returns, use `aerospace debug-windows` to
  verify that the Pet is classified as a popup rather than a managed window.

## Gotchas

- **App matching**: Uses `app-name-regex-substring` (partial match) or `app-id` for specific bundle IDs
- **Terminals float on workspace 1**: Ghostty, Alacritty, cmux, and Warp all use `layout floating` and pin to workspace 1, since they rely on native macOS tabs/windows rather than aerospace tiling. (Ghostty workspace switching historically went through tmux.)
- **YouTube PWA PiP can vanish**: The `YouTube` app is a Brave app-mode wrapper (`com.brave.Browser.app...`), but its PiP window is owned by the parent `Brave Browser` process. If PiP disappears, check whether `Brave Browser` is hidden while `YouTube` is visible. `aerospace-pip-guardian auto` usually recovers this; use `ctrl-alt-p` for manual recovery.
- **Zero gaps**: `[gaps]` section has all values at 0
- **Mouse follows monitor**: When focus changes monitors, mouse moves to center
- **No generic sticky windows**: Feature not yet supported (issue #2). The
  Codex Pet does not require it because AeroSpace recognizes the Pet as an
  unmanaged popup.
- **Reserved bindings**: `alt-r` and `alt-x` are commented out

## Adding New App Assignment

```toml
[[on-window-detected]]
if.app-name-regex-substring = 'AppName'
run = 'move-node-to-workspace X'

# Or for floating:
run = ['layout floating', 'move-node-to-workspace X']

# Or by bundle ID (more precise):
if.app-id = 'com.company.appname'
```

Find app bundle ID: `osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'`
